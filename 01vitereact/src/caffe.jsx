// Simple js file with a simple function returning a basic statement...
// Name has to start with a capital letter 
function Caffe(){
    return(
        <h3>The coffee is ready. Today is sponsered by Coffee !!</h3>
    )
}

export default Caffe // To export the function for different file to access - can be imported to app.jsx or main.jsx... both are fine, also js and jsx are kinda same no issues in creat-react-app.... 

// for using vite to create components it's necessary to use jsx extention !!
